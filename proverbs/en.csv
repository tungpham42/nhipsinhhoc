You get in touch with Mother Earth and eating in such a way, you feel in touch with true life, your roots, and that is meditation. If we chew every morsel of our food in that way we become grateful and when you are grateful, you are happy.|Thich Nhat Hanh
Enlightenment is always there. Small enlightenment will bring great enlightenment. If you breathe in and are aware that you are alive - that you can touch the miracle of being alive - then that is a kind of enlightenment.|Thich Nhat Hanh
Changing is not just changing the things outside of us. First of all we need the right view that transcends all notions including of being and non-being, creator and creature, mind and spirit. That kind of insight is crucial for transformation and healing.|Thich Nhat Hanh

There is no way to happiness - happiness is the way.|Thich Nhat Hanh
In the past there were people who were not rich but contented with their living style, laughing and happy all day.

The situation the Earth is in today has been created by unmindful production and unmindful consumption. We consume to forget our worries and our anxieties. Tranquilising ourselves with over-consumption is not the way.|Thich Nhat Hanh
You practice mindfulness, on the one hand, to be calm and peaceful. On the other hand, as you practice mindfulness and live a life of peace, you inspire hope for a future of peace.|Thich Nhat Hanh

We will be more successful in all our endeavors if we can let go of the habit of running all the time, and take little pauses to relax and re-center ourselves. And we'll also have a lot more joy in living.|Thich Nhat Hanh
We fear that this moment will end, that we won't get what we need, that we will lose what we love, or that we will not be safe. Often, our biggest fear is the knowledge that one day our bodies will cease functioning. So even when we are surrounded by all the conditions for happiness, our joy is not complete.|Thich Nhat Hanh
It is possible to live happily in the here and the now. So many conditions of happiness are available - more than enough for you to be happy right now. You don't have to run into the future in order to get more.|Thich Nhat Hanh

Many people are alive but don't touch the miracle of being alive.|Thich Nhat Hanh
Anger is like a storm rising up from the bottom of your consciousness. When you feel it coming, turn your focus to your breath.|Thich Nhat Hanh
Fear, separation, hate and anger come from the wrong view that you and the Earth are two separate entities, the Earth is only the environment. You are in the centre and you want to do something for the Earth in order for you to survive. That is a dualistic way of seeing.|Thich Nhat Hanh
When we have peace, then we have a chance to save the planet. But if we are not united in peace, if we do not practice mindful consumption, we cannot save our planet.|Thich Nhat Hanh
You are a child of the sun, you come from the sun, and that is something true with the Earth also... your relationship with the Earth is so deep, and the Earth is in you and this is something not very difficult, much less difficult then philosophy.|Thich Nhat Hanh
Mother Earth is very talented. She has produced Buddhas, bodhisattvas, great beings.|Thich Nhat Hanh

With compassion you can die for other people, like the mother who can die for her child. You have the courage to say it because you are not afraid of losing anything, because you know that understanding and love is the foundation of happiness. But if you have fear of losing your status, your position, you will not have the courage to do it.|Thich Nhat Hanh
Buddhism teaches us not to try to run away from suffering. You have to confront suffering. You have to look deeply into the nature of suffering in order to recognize its cause, the making of the suffering.|Thich Nhat Hanh
When you learn about the teaching and the practice of another tradition, you always have a chance to understand your own teaching and practice.|Thich Nhat Hanh
Civilisations have been destroyed many times, and this civilisation is no different. It can be destroyed. We can think of time in terms of millions of years and life will resume little by little. The cosmos operates for us very urgently, but geological time is different.|Thich Nhat Hanh
We have to continue to learn. We have to be open. And we have to be ready to release our knowledge in order to come to a higher understanding of reality.|Thich Nhat Hanh
You accept that this civilisation could be abolished and life will begin later on after a few thousand years because that is something that has happened in the history of this planet. When you have peace in yourself and accept, then you are calm enough to do something, but if you are carried by despair there is no hope.|Thich Nhat Hanh
We can continue to learn generation after generation and now is time to begin to learn how to love in a non-discriminatory way because we are intelligent enough, but we are not loving enough as a species.|Thich Nhat Hanh

Walk as if you are kissing the Earth with your feet.|Thich Nhat Hanh

Sometimes your joy is the source of your smile, but sometimes your smile can be the source of your joy.|Thich Nhat Hanh
People usually consider walking on water or in thin air a miracle. But I think the real miracle is not to walk either on water or in thin air, but to walk on earth. Every day we are engaged in a miracle which we don't even recognize: a blue sky, white clouds, green leaves, the black, curious eyes of a child -- our own two eyes. All is a miracle.|Thich Nhat Hanh
People say walking on water is a miracle, but to me walking peacefully on earth is the real miracle.|Thich Nhat Hanh
When you plant lettuce, if it does not grow well, you don't blame the lettuce. You look for reasons it is not doing well. It may need fertilizer, or more water, or less sun. You never blame the lettuce. Yet if we have problems with our friends or family, we blame the other person. But if we know how to take care of them, they will grow well, like the lettuce. Blaming has no positive effect at all, nor does trying to persuade using reason and argument. That is my experience. No blame, no reasoning, no argument, just understanding. If you understand, and you show that you understand, you can love, and the situation will change.|Thich Nhat Hanh
Letting go gives us freedom, and freedom is the only condition for happiness. If, in our heart, we still cling to anything - anger, anxiety, or possessions - we cannot be free.|Thich Nhat Hanh

Through my love for you, I want to express my love for the whole cosmos, the whole of humanity, and all beings. By living with you, I want to learn to love everyone and all species.

My actions are my only true belongings.|Thich Nhat Hanh
Breathing in, I calm body and mind. Breathing out, I smile. Dwelling in the present moment I know this is the only moment.|Thich Nhat Hanh

Drink your tea slowly and reverently, as if it is the axis on which the world earth revolves - slowly, evenly, without rushing toward the future.|Thich Nhat Hanh
For things to reveal themselves to us, we need to be ready to abandon our views about them.|Thich Nhat Hanh
By eating meat we share the responsibility of climate change, the destruction of our forests, and the poisoning of our air and water. The simple act of becoming a vegetarian will make a difference in the health of our planet.|Thich Nhat Hanh
Our own life has to be our message.|Thich Nhat Hanh
We are here to awaken from our illusion of separateness.|Thich Nhat Hanh
You must love in such a way that the person you love feels free.|Thich Nhat Hanh

The mind can go in a thousand directions, but on this beautiful path, I walk in peace. With each step, the wind blows. With each step, a flower blooms.|Thich Nhat Hanh
When we are mindful, deeply in touch with the present moment, our understanding of what is going on deepens, and we begin to be filled with acceptance, joy, peace and love.|Thich Nhat Hanh
When you say something really unkind, when you do something in retaliation your anger increases. You make the other person suffer, and he will try hard to say or to do something back to get relief from his suffering. That is how conflict escalates.|Thich Nhat Hanh
Compassion is a verb.|Thich Nhat Hanh
We often think of peace as the absence of war, that if powerful countries would reduce their weapon arsenals, we could have peace. But if we look deeply into the weapons, we see our own minds- our own prejudices, fears and ignorance. Even if we transport all the bombs to the moon, the roots of war and the roots of bombs are still there, in our hearts and minds, and sooner or later we will make new bombs. To work for peace is to uproot war from ourselves and from the hearts of men and women. To prepare for war, to give millions of men and women the opportunity to practice killing day and night in their hearts, is to plant millions of seeds of violence, anger, frustration, and fear that will be passed on for generations to come.|Thich Nhat Hanh
If you love someone, the greatest gift you can give them is your presence.|Thich Nhat Hanh
Feelings, whether of compassion or irritation, should be welcomed, recognized, and treated on an absolutely equal basis; because both are ourselves. The tangerine I am eating is me. The mustard greens I am planting are me. I plant with all my heart and mind. I clean this teapot with the kind of attention I would have were I giving the baby Buddha or Jesus a bath. Nothing should be treated more carefully than anything else. In mindfulness, compassion, irritation, mustard green plant, and teapot are all sacred.|Thich Nhat Hanh
I have noticed that people are dealing too much with the negative, with what is wrong. ... Why not try the other way, to look into the patient and see positive things, to just touch those things and make them bloom?|Thich Nhat Hanh
Keeping your body healthy is an expression of gratitude to the whole cosmos - the trees, the clouds, everything.|Thich Nhat Hanh

The wave does not need to die to become water. She is already water.|Thich Nhat Hanh
Usually when we hear or read something new, we just compare it to our own ideas. If it is the same, we accept it and say that it is correct. If it is not, we say it is incorrect. In either case, we learn nothing.|Thich Nhat Hanh
It is said that God has created man in his own image. But it may be that humankind has created God in the image of humankind.|Thich Nhat Hanh
It is my conviction that there is no way to peace - peace is the way.|Thich Nhat Hanh
My actions are my only true belongings. I cannot escape the consequences of my actions. My actions are the ground on which I stand.|Thich Nhat Hanh
Thanks to impermanence, everything is possible.|Thich Nhat Hanh
Around us, life bursts with miracles--a glass of water, a ray of sunshine, a leaf, a caterpillar, a flower, laughter, raindrops. If you live in awareness, it is easy to see miracles everywhere. Each human being is a multiplicity of miracles. Eyes that see thousands of colors, shapes, and forms; ears that hear a bee flying or a thunderclap; a brain that ponders a speck of dust as easily as the entire cosmos; a heart that beats in rhythm with the heartbeat of all beings. When we are tired and feel discouraged by life's daily struggles, we may not notice these miracles, but they are always there.|Thich Nhat Hanh

The most precious gift we can offer anyone is our attention. When mindfulness embraces those we love, they will bloom like flowers.|Thich Nhat Hanh
To dwell in the here and now does not mean you never think about the past or responsibly plan for the future. The idea is simply not to allow yourself to get lost in regrets about the past or worries about the future. If you are firmly grounded in the present moment, the past can be an object of inquiry, the object of your mindfulness and concentration. You can attain many insights by looking into the past. But you are still grounded in the present moment.|Thich Nhat Hanh
Peace is present right here and now, in ourselves and in everything we do and see. Every breath we take, every step we take, can be filled with peace, joy, and serenity. The question is whether or not we are in touch with it. We need only to be awake, alive in the present moment.|Thich Nhat Hanh
If our love is only a will to possess, it is not love.|Thich Nhat Hanh
When we walk like (we are rushing), we print anxiety and sorrow on the earth. We have to walk in a way that we only print peace and serenity on the earth... Be aware of the contact between your feet and the earth. Walk as if you are kissing the earth with your feet.|Thich Nhat Hanh
When you begin to see that your enemy is suffering, that is the beginning of insight.|Thich Nhat Hanh
Until there is peace between religions, there can be no peace in the world.|Thich Nhat Hanh

At any moment, you have a choice, that either leads you closer to your spirit or further away from it.|Thich Nhat Hanh
A real love letter is made of insight, understanding, and compassion. Otherwise it's not a love letter. A true love letter can produce a transformation in the other person, and therefore in the world. But before it produces a transformation in the other person, it has to produce a transformation within us. Some letters may take the whole of our lifetime to write.|Thich Nhat Hanh
Attachment to views is the greatest impediment to the spiritual path.|Thich Nhat Hanh
If we are not fully ourselves, truly in the present moment, we miss everything.|Thich Nhat Hanh

From time to time, to remind ourselves to relax and be peaceful, we may wish to set aside some time for a retreat, a day of mindfulness, when we can walk slowly, smile, drink tea with a friend, enjoy being together as if we are the happiest people on Earth.|Thich Nhat Hanh
In modern society most of us don't want to be in touch with ourselves; we want to be in touch with other things like religion, sports, politics, a book - we want to forget ourselves. Anytime we have leisure, we want to invite something else to enter us, opening ourselves to the television and telling the television to come and colonize us.|Thich Nhat Hanh
Some people live as though they are already dead. There are people moving around us who are consumed by their past, terrified of their future, and stuck in their anger and jealousy. They are not alive; they are just walking corpses.|Thich Nhat Hanh
In true dialogue, both sides are willing to change.|Thich Nhat Hanh
I am determined to practice deep listening. I am determined to practice loving speech.|Thich Nhat Hanh
The kingdom of God is available to you in the here and the now. But the question is whether you are available to the kingdom. Our practice is to make ourselves ready for the kingdom so that it can manifest in the here and the now. You don't need to die in order to enter the kingdom of heaven. In fact, you have to be truly alive in order to do so.|Thich Nhat Hanh
If we are peaceful, if we are happy, we can smile and blossom like a flower, and everyone in our family, our entire society, will benefit from our peace.|Thich Nhat Hanh
Do not avoid contact with suffering or close your eyes before suffering. Do not lose awareness of the existence of suffering in the life of the world. Find ways to be with those who are suffering by all means, including personal contact and visits, images, sounds. By such means, ...awaken yourself and others to the reality of suffering in the world. If we get in touch with the suffering of the world, and are moved by that suffering, we may come forward to help the people who are suffering.|Thich Nhat Hanh
The miracle is not to walk on water. The miracle is to walk on the green earth, dwelling deeply in the present moment and feeling truly alive.|Thich Nhat Hanh
To live in the present moment is a miracle. The miracle is not to walk on water. The miracle is to walk on the green Earth in the present moment, to appreciate the peace and beauty that are available now.|Thich Nhat Hanh
Our notions about happiness entrap us. We forget that they are just ideas. Our idea of happiness can prevent us from actually being happy. We fail to see the opportunity for joy that is right in front of us when we are caught in a belief that happiness should take a particular form.|Thich Nhat Hanh
In mindfulness one is not only restful and happy, but alert and awake. Meditation is not evasion; it is a serene encounter with reality.|Thich Nhat Hanh
You are not an observer, you are a participant.|Thich Nhat Hanh
I would not look upon anger as something foreign to me that I have to fight... I have to deal with my anger with care, with love, with tenderness, with nonviolence.|Thich Nhat Hanh
If we do not know how to take care of ourselves and to love ourselves, we cannot take care of the people we love. Loving oneself is the foundation for loving another person.|Thich Nhat Hanh
Breath is the bridge which connects life to consciousness, which unites your body to your thoughts. Whenever your mind becomes scattered, use your breath as the means to take hold of your mind again.|Thich Nhat Hanh
Those who are without compassion cannot see what is seen with the eyes of compassion.|Thich Nhat Hanh
The fact is that when you make the other suffer, he will try to find relief by making you suffer more. The result is an escalation of suffering on both sides.|Thich Nhat Hanh
It is possible to live twenty-four hours a day in a state of love. Every movement, every glance, every thought, and every word can be infused with love.|Thich Nhat Hanh
Please don't wait until the doctors tell you that you are going to have a baby to begin to take care of it. It is already there. Whatever you are, whatever you do, your baby will get it. Anything you eat, any worries that are on your mind will be for him or her. Can you tell me that you cannot smile? Think of the baby, and smile for him, for her, for the future generations. Please don't tell me that a smile and your sorrow just don't go together. It's your sorrow, but what about your baby? It's not his sorrow, its not her sorrow.|Thich Nhat Hanh
There is no enlightenment outside of daily life.|Thich Nhat Hanh
Being rich is an obstacle to loving. When you are rich, you want to continue to be rich, and so you end up devoting all your time, all your energy, in your daily life to stay rich.|Thich Nhat Hanh
I am inviting you to go deeper, to learn and to practice so that you become someone who has a great capacity for being solid, calm, and without fear, because our society needs people like you who have these qualities, and your children, our children, need people like you, in order to go on, in order to become solid, and calm, and without fear.|Thich Nhat Hanh
We have negative mental habits that come up over and over again. One of the most significant negative habits we should be aware of is that of constantly allowing our mind to run off into the future. Perhaps we got this from our parents. Carried away by our worries, we're unable to live fully and happily in the present. Deep down, we believe we can't really be happy just yet—that we still have a few more boxes to be checked off before we can really enjoy life. We speculate, dream, strategize, and plan for these "conditions of happiness" we want to have in the future; and we continually chase after that future, even while we sleep. We may have fears about the future because we don't know how it's going to turn out, and these worries and anxieties keep us from enjoying being here now.|Thich Nhat Hanh
Guarding knowledge is not a good way to understand. Understanding means to throw away your knowledge.|Thich Nhat Hanh
Being vegetarian here also means that we do not consume dairy and egg products, because they are products of the meat industry. If we stop consuming, they will stop producing. Only collective awakening can create enough determination for action.|Thich Nhat Hanh
Only the present moment contains life.|Thich Nhat Hanh
A human being is like a television set with millions of channels.... We cannot let just one channel dominate us. We have the seed of everything in us, and we have to recover our own sovereignty.|Thich Nhat Hanh
As long as you find something beautiful, good, and true to believe in and abide by, you have the equivalent of God in your life.|Thich Nhat Hanh
May our heart's garden of awakening bloom with hundreds of flowers.|Thich Nhat Hanh
If you touch one thing with deep awareness, you touch everything.|Thich Nhat Hanh
Awareness is like the sun. When it shines on things, they are transformed.|Thich Nhat Hanh
An oak tree is an oak tree. That is all it has to do. If an oak tree is less than an oak tree, then we are all in trouble.|Thich Nhat Hanh
Your breathing should flow gracefully, like a river, like a watersnake crossing the water, and not like a chain of rugged mountains or the gallop of a horse. To master our breath is to be in control of our bodies and minds. Each time we find ourselves dispersed and find it difficult to gain control of ourselves by different means, the method of watching the breath should always be used.|Thich Nhat Hanh
We who have touched war have a duty to bring the truth about war to those who have not had a direct experience of it. We are the light at the tip of the candle. It is really hot, but it has the power of shining and illuminating. If we practice mindfulness, we will know how to look deeply into the nature of war and, with our insight, wake people up so that together we can avoid repeating the same horrors again and again.|Thich Nhat Hanh
Anxiety, the illness of our time, comes primarily from our inability to dwell in the present moment.|Thich Nhat Hanh
Life can be found only in the present moment. The past is gone, the future is not yet here, and if we do not go back to ourselves in the present moment, we cannot be in touch with life.|Thich Nhat Hanh
The difference between successful people and very successful people is that very successful people say 'no' to almost everything.|Warren Buffett
Determination is the key ingredient for every entrepreneur.|Jason Calacanis
In order to sign out of a system, you have to sign in first.|Tung Pham
One of the penalties for refusing to participate in politics is that you end up being governed by your inferiors.|Plato
There are only two feelings, love and fear. There are only two languages, love and fear. There are only two activities, love and fear. There are only two motives, love and fear. Two procedures, two frameworks, two results; love and fear, love and fear.|Michael Lennig

Healing is a matter of time, but it is sometimes also a matter of opportunity.|Hippocrates
We can make a commitment to promote vegetables and fruits and whole grains on every part of every menu. We can make portion sizes smaller and emphasize quality over quantity.

I made a commitment to completely cut out drinking and anything that might hamper me from getting my mind and body together. And the floodgates of goodness have opened upon me - spiritually and financially.|Denzel Washington
The art of healing comes from nature, not from the physician. Therefore the physician must start from nature, with an open mind.|Paracelsus
A desire to be in charge of our own lives, a need for control, is born in each of us. It is essential to our mental health, and our success, that we take control.|Robert Foster Bennett

You might have more talent than me, you might be smarter than me, you might be sexier than me, you might be all of those things you got it on me in nine categories. But if we get on the treadmill together, there's two things: You're getting off first, or I'm going to die. It's really that simple, right?|Will Smith

Love knows not distance; it hath no continent; its eyes are for the stars.|Gilbert Parker
Stolen kisses are always sweetest.|Leigh Hunt
It is often difficult to judge how our actions and their impact on the environment are likely to affect others. What is clear is that we are the only species with the power to destroy the earth. Birds and insects have no such power, nor does any other mammal. And yet if we have the capacity to destroy the earth, we also have the capacity to protect it. I believe we have an urgent responsibility to do so.|Dalai Lama
I'm sure all of us agree that we need to overcome violence, but we first need to examine whether it has any value. From a strictly practical perspective, on certain occasions violence appears to be useful. We can solve a problem quickly by force. But this success is often at the expense of the rights and welfare of others. Although one problem has been solved, the seed of another has been planted.|Dalai Lama
Experience has shown me that the greatest inner tranquillity comes from developing love and compassion. The more we care for the happiness of others, the greater is our own sense of well-being. Cultivating a close, warm-hearted feeling for others automatically puts the mind at ease. It helps remove our fears and insecurities and gives us strength to face obstacles - it is the ultimate source of success in life.|Dalai Lama
The interesting thing about greed is that although the underlying motive is to seek satisfaction, even after obtaining what you want, you're still not satisfied. It's this endless, nagging desire for more that leads to trouble. On the other hand, if you're truly contented, it doesn't matter whether you get what you want or not. Either way, you remain content.|Dalai Lama
Destructive thoughts and emotions undermine the very causes of peace and happiness. If you think clearly about it, it makes no sense to think you're seeking happiness, if you do nothing to restrain angry, spiteful, and malicious thoughts and emotions.|Dalai Lama
Because past environmental destruction was the result of ignorance, we can easily forgive it. Today, we are better informed. Therefore, it's essential that we make an ethical examination of what we have inherited, what we are responsible for, and what we will pass on to coming generations. Ours is clearly a pivotal generation. We have global communication and yet confrontation is more common than dialogue.|Dalai Lama
The future will be in the hands of those of you who belong to the 21st century. You have the opportunity and responsibility to build a better humanity. This means developing warm-heartedness in this very life, here and now. So, do whatever work you do, but ask yourselves now and then, "How can I contribute to human beings being happier and more peaceful?"|Dalai Lama
There are three reasons I try to promote human values as a source of happiness. Firstly, the kindness and affection we are shown by our mothers is our common experience. Secondly, it's common sense that if a family is wealthy, but lacks basic kindness and affection, its members will likely be unhappy. Thirdly, even scientists today are finding evidence that the really effective source of happiness is peace of mind.|Dalai Lama
We need a sense of the oneness of the 7 billion human beings alive today. When I meet people, I don't think about being different from them, about being Tibetan, Buddhist or even the Dalai Lama. I only think about being a human being. We all share the potential for positive and negative emotions, yet one of our special qualities is our human mind, our intelligence. If we use it well we'll be successful and happy.|Dalai Lama
If our minds are ruled by destructive emotions, by self-centredness, with little regard for others, we won't be happy. As social animals we need to work together. With friends around us, we feel secure, happy and our minds are calm. We're physically well too. When we're filled with anger, fear and frustration, our minds are upset and our health declines. Therefore, the ultimate source of happiness is warmheartedness.|Dalai Lama
Instead of wasting millions of dollars on weapons we dare never use, the money should be put to more positive ends. And it's no use waiting for our leaders to take action, we the people have to take action to show our disapproval of these instruments of war and violence. This is in our interest, because invariably when things go wrong it's ordinary people who suffer.|Dalai Lama
Everyone wants to be happy; happiness is a right. And while on a secondary level differences exist of nationality, faith, family background, social status and so on, more important is that on a human level we are the same. None of us wants to face problems, and yet we create them by stressing our differences. If we see each other just as fellow human beings, there'll be no basis for fighting or conflict between us.|Dalai Lama
We need to employ a secular approach to ethics, secular in the Indian sense of respecting all religious traditions and even the views of non-believers in an unbiased way. Secular ethics rooted in scientific findings, common experience and common sense can easily be introduced into the secular education system. If we can do that there is a real prospect of making this 21st century an era of peace and compassion.|Dalai Lama
We are social animals who need friends. We need a community to survive. Friends are made on the basis of trust, which only grows if you are kind to people. Exploiting, cheating and bullying others will win you no friends. Kindness and compassion gives rise to self confidence, which in turn empowers you to be honest, truthful and transparent. This self-confidence brings peace of mind, which also favours good health.|Dalai Lama
There are grounds for optimism when you think that in the early 20th century few people used the word compassion, but nowadays even politicians talk about it. Similarly, a century ago hardly anyone thought about ecology and the environment the way they do today. What's more, in the early 20th century people regarded war and the use of force as the only way to resolve problems, and today that has changed.|Dalai Lama
If our generation exploits everything available – trees, water, and minerals – without any thought for the coming generations, we'll be at fault. But if we're motivated by a genuine sense of universal responsibility our relations with the environment and our relations with our neighbours, both at home and abroad, will be more balanced.|Dalai Lama
In our modern society everything seems geared to material development, even our systems of education. As a result we no longer pay sufficient attention to our inner values, which leads to mental unrest. In order to address this imbalance we need to pay more attention to our minds.|Dalai Lama
It is important to teach schoolchildren that violence is a fruitless approach to solving problems. The use of violence and force inevitably entails unanticipated consequences and rarely any solution. It would be much better if children grew up accustomed to the idea that the proper way to resolve problems is through dialogue, through reaching a mutually agreeable solution.|Dalai Lama
We are all the same as human beings, we all want to lead a happy life. We can think of every day as a new day. When we wake up we can remind ourselves - 'I need to be happy, I need to have warm feelings towards others. This builds self-confidence, honesty, transparency, which leads to trust. And trust is the basis of friendship. We are social animals and we need friends. This is a source of happiness I wish to share.|Dalai Lama
Depression seems to be related to fear, anger and frustration. When you're in a bad mood, even if you meet with your friends, you don't take pleasure in their company. But when you're in a good mood, even if things go wrong, you can cope with them without difficulty. This is why putting yourself in a good mood, making a point of developing a sense of loving kindness gives you greater inner strength.|Dalai Lama
As a human being I acknowledge that my well-being depends on others and caring for others' well-being is a moral responsibility I take seriously. It's unrealistic to think that the future of humanity can be achieved on the basis of prayer or good wishes alone; what we need is to take action. Therefore, my first commitment is to contribute to human happiness as best I can.|Dalai Lama
Like anyone else, I too have anger in me. However, I try to recall that anger is a destructive emotion. I remind myself that scientists now say that anger is bad for our health; it eats into our immune system. So, anger destroys our peace of mind and our physical health. We shouldn't welcome it or think of it as natural or as a friend.|Dalai Lama
The 20th century saw the destructive power of technology reach unthinkable levels, including the actual use of nuclear weapons. In Hiroshima I met survivors who told me of their terrible experiences. Trying to solve disputes through violence is completely out of date. We have to work to abolish nuclear weapons, but we must also build trust and friendship between nations, which requires we engage in dialogue.|Dalai Lama
I thank my friends across the world for your greetings on my 80th birthday. Since we all seek happiness and try to avoid suffering, we have a responsibility to bring about the well-being of all living beings. I appeal to you to promote ethical values imbued with love and compassion, to work to calm the conflicts going on in many parts of the world, to foster interreligious harmony and protect our natural environment.|Dalai Lama
All beings want to live a happy life, but only humans have the ability to analyze its causes. Although the mind is fundamentally pure, when we develop anger, attachment or even compassion, the mind seems to be suffused with that emotion. Anger is a disturbing emotion based on a wrong view, the misconception that things exist the way they appear. Constructive emotions are generally more realistic.|Dalai Lama
In our quest for happiness and the avoidance of suffering, we are all fundamentally the same, and therefore equal. Despite all the characteristics that differentiate us - race, language, religion, gender, wealth and many others - we are all equal in terms of our basic humanity.|Dalai Lama
When we say "I love the members of my own family, the people of my own religion or country or color" bias limits our affection. But with proper practice, from an ordinary level of affection we can develop an unbiased universal love, in which we don't care what other people's faith is, their nationality, or social status - so long as they are human beings, they are our brothers and sisters.|Dalai Lama
Change in ourselves and in the world in which we live may not take place in a hurry: it will take time. But if we don't make an effort nothing will happen at all. Change will not take place because of decisions taken by governments or the UN. Real change will take place when individuals transform themselves guided by the values that lie at the core of all human ethical systems, scientific findings, and common sense.|Dalai Lama
I believe that to meet the challenges of our times, human beings will have to develop a greater sense of universal responsibility. Each of us must learn to work not just for one self, one's own family or one's nation, but for the benefit of all humankind. Universal responsibility is the key to human survival, it is the foundation for world peace.|Dalai Lama
In our daily life, we feel happy when someone smiles and treats us with affection. But if they frown we feel uncomfortable. This is a sign that we need friends. Friendship doesn't depend on fame, money or physical strength. It's based on trust and trust depends on love and affection. Therefore, love and affection are important if we are to live a happy life.|Dalai Lama
Compassion reduces our fear, boosts our confidence, and opens us to inner strength. By reducing distrust, it opens us to others and brings us a sense of connections with them and a sense of purpose and meaning in life.|Dalai Lama
I sometimes wish that grown human beings were more like children, who are naturally open and accepting of others. Instead, as we grow up, we fail to nurture our natural potential and our sense of fundamental human values. We need to learn to distinguish emotions like anger and attachment that are destructive from positive ones like compassion that are a source of happiness.|Dalai Lama
We should feel fed up with the violence and killing going on around us. If a human being is killed by an animal, it's sad, but if a human being is killed by another human being it's unthinkable. We have to make a special effort to think of each other as fellow human beings, as our brothers and sisters.|Dalai Lama
The technical progress we have made in the 21st century may have improved our material comfort, but there is no guarantee that it will bring us inner peace. We have to be careful that new forms of knowledge don't just become tools for our anger and fear, that they don't merely increase our destructive power. We need to remind ourselves that our own future depends on the rest of humanity.|Dalai Lama
I'm really happy to see leaders and governments taking climate change and global warming seriously. Very encouraging. In the past I noticed people were not really serious about it. What they'd agreed, they didn't fully implement. They placed national interest first and global interest second. Now climate change affects everybody. Treat it as a global issue and national interests will automatically be addressed.|Dalai Lama
If you live your life honestly and truthfully, you'll be open and transparent, which leads to trust. And trust leads to friendship. This is something worth taking into account, that the basis of friendship is trust not money and warm-heartedness is essential if we are to live happy lives.|Dalai Lama
We face many problems, many of them man-made. It is our responsibility to solve them. We need to use our human intelligence to do this. No one seeks out suffering; everyone just wants to be happy. But out of short-sightedness we hatch plans that bring us trouble. We need to find human solutions. We need to consider the needs of coming generations.|Dalai Lama
Karma means action and action motivated by compassion is good. To complain that what happens to you is just the result of your karma is lazy. Instead, confidently recalling the advice that, "You are your own master," you can change what happens by taking action.|Dalai Lama
Love and compassion are necessities, not luxuries. Without them humanity cannot survive.|Dalai Lama
If you live your life honestly and truthfully, you'll be open and transparent, which leads to trust. And trust leads to friendship. This is something worth taking into account, that the basis of friendship is trust not money and warm-heartedness is essential if we are to live happy lives.|Dalai Lama
Share your knowledge. It’s a way to achieve immortality.|Dalai Lama
I have decided to stick with love. Hate is too great a burden to bear.|Martin Luther King, Jr.

There is no remedy for love but to love more.|Henry David Thoreau
I love that feeling of being in love, the effect of having butterflies when you wake up in the morning. That is special.|Jennifer Aniston
Love is that condition in which the happiness of another person is essential to your own... Jealousy is a disease, love is a healthy condition. The immature mind often mistakes one for the other, or assumes that the greater the love, the greater the jealousy.|Robert A. Heinlein
Love is like a beautiful flower which I may not touch, but whose fragrance makes the garden a place of delight just the same.|Helen Keller

Love is being stupid together.|Paul Valery
Love is when he gives you a piece of your soul, that you never knew was missing.|Torquato Tasso

Love is the wisdom of the fool and the folly of the wise.|Samuel Johnson
The course of true love never did run smooth.|William Shakespeare
Kindness in words creates confidence. Kindness in thinking creates profoundness. Kindness in giving creates love.|Lao Tzu

The best proof of love is trust.|Joyce Brothers
Love has no age, no limit; and no death.|John Galsworthy
When love is not madness, it is not love.|Pedro Calderon de la Barca
Love is like a friendship caught on fire. In the beginning a flame, very pretty, often hot and fierce, but still only light and flickering. As love grows older, our hearts mature and our love becomes as coals, deep-burning and unquenchable.|Bruce Lee
All my life, my heart has yearned for a thing I cannot name.|Andre Breton
We're born alone, we live alone, we die alone. Only through our love and friendship can we create the illusion for the moment that we're not alone.|Orson Welles
A woman knows the face of the man she loves as a sailor knows the open sea.|Honore de Balzac
Love is a force more formidable than any other. It is invisible - it cannot be seen or measured, yet it is powerful enough to transform you in a moment, and offer you more joy than any material possession could.|Barbara de Angelis
The first duty of love is to listen.|Paul Tillich
We loved with a love that was more than love.|Edgar Allan Poe
We love life, not because we are used to living but because we are used to loving.|Friedrich Nietzsche
I believe that imagination is stronger than knowledge. That myth is more potent than history. That dreams are more powerful than facts. That hope always triumphs over experience. That laughter is the only cure for grief. And I believe that love is stronger than death.|Robert Fulghum
Love is composed of a single soul inhabiting two bodies.|Aristotle
Love doesn't make the world go 'round. Love is what makes the ride worthwhile.|Franklin P. Jones

We do not have time to wait for the en­lightenment of our neighbors so that we can work together toward the development of Asia.

Robbery and murder are the worst of human crimes; but in the West there are robbers and murderers. There are those who form cliques to vie for the reins of power and who, when deprived of that power, decry the injustice of it all. Even worse, international diplomacy is really based on the art of deception. Surveying the situation as a whole, all we can say is that there is a general prevalence of good over bad, but we can hardly call the situation perfect. When, several thousand years hence, the levels of knowledge and virtue of the peoples of the world will have made great progress (to the point of becoming utopian), the present condition of the nations of the West will surely seem a pitifully primitive stage. Seen in this light, civilization is an open-ended process. We cannot be satisfied with the present level of attainment of the West.|Fukuzawa Yukichi
